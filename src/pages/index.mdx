## Abstract

Pancreas MRI segmentation remains challenging due to heterogeneous acquisition protocols and the limited availability of annotated multi-sequence data. While prior studies have examined cross-center robustness, the impact of variations across MRI sequences has received far less attention. We present CrossPan, a comprehensive empirical benchmark for evaluating segmentation robustness under heterogeneous abdominal MRI sequences. The benchmark comprises 1386 3D scans from eight institutions across three routinely acquired sequences (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and Out-of-Phase). Across five tasks, we find that: (i) cross-sequence shifts constitute a substantially more severe challenge than cross-center variability; (ii) state-of-the-art DG methods show limited effectiveness in bridging the gap, while zero-shot foundation models exhibit heterogeneous robustness; and (iii) semi-supervised learning offers moderate gains at mid-range label ratios but remains unstable under extreme scarcity and exhibits strong sequence dependence. These results highlight the fundamental difficulty of cross-sequence generalization in abdominal MRI and position CrossPan as a rigorous platform for advancing robust and clinically reliable pancreas segmentation.
