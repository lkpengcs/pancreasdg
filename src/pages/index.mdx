## Abstract

Most medical segmentation statistical learning algorithms operate under an oversimplified assumption: training and testing data are independent and identically distributed. This assumption often fails in real-world medical imaging scenarios due to variations in acquisition devices, imaging protocols, and even patient characteristics. Particularly for MRI imaging, many different types of imaging sequences play crucial roles in clinical MRI imaging, yet the impact of domain shifts between these sequences has remained unexplored. Such domain shifts pose significant challenges to model performance, which is however a more realistic clinical scenario given that the vast diversity of imaging sequences makes it impractical to enumerate explicitly. To fairly evaluate the challenging domain shift issues, we propose one novel challenging PancreasDG MRI segmentation task consisting of domain shift across different data centers and different acquisition time: from venous phase to out-of-phase. This more realistic and challenging cross-phase setting reveals many significant differences which has never been investigated before in terms of domain shift influence compared with the widely used cross-center setting. To address the challenge of domain shift issues, we propose a large-scale pre-trained model that encompasses a diverse range of anatomical categories as a robust starting point. To further enhance performance in tasks constrained by limited annotated data, we propose an Exponential Moving Average (EMA)-based teacher model to guide semisupervised learning on large-scale unlabeled MRI data.  Extensive experiments validate the superior effectiveness of robust pretraining to overcome challenging domain shifts where most robustness segmentation methods fail. All data and code are publicly available [here](https://github.com/NUBagciLab/nnUNetDG).

To avoid the segmentation collapse, we add the graph segmentation result as the regularization such that we can further extend the model's performance on the general segmentation tasks."
